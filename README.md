Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**. 
Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/ 
Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device & web versions of WhatsApp.
**Baileys** is a WebSockets-based TypeScript library for interacting with the WhatsApp Web API.  
This is **not the official Baileys library**, but a **modified and extended version** developed independently to add functionalities that many developers have requested. These enhancements aim to improve flexibility, offer better developer experience, and provide tools that are missing from the original version.
